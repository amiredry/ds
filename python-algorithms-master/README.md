=================

This repository contains the code associated with the "Working With Algorithms In Python" Safari Video.

The order of the videos in the final short course is listed below

  1.  Log N Behavior 	
  *.  Big O SideBar 	
  2.  O(n log n) Behavior
  3.  Mathematical Algorithms
  4.  Brute Force Algorithms 
  5.  KD Tree Data Structure 	
  6.  DepthFirstSearch 	
  7.  Seven All Pairs Shortest Path
  8.  Heap 	
  9.  Single-Source Shortest Path
  

Each module introduces a real-world problem and presents a Naive approach towards solving that problem.
Invariably one can do better, with the right data structure and elegant algorithm. Each module has a 
corresponding problem that is either closely related, or which can be solved using a variation of the
algorithms developed for that module.

The "* Big O SideBar" module introduces terminology used to analyze the algorithms whose code is contained
in these modules.

All presentation slides used during the recording of the videos are found in the "Presentation Slides" folder as PDF documents.
